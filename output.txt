🌆 City: Pune
🌡️ Temperature: 31.0°C
🏠 Recommended: with the weather in pune being described as "patchy rain nearby" and a small chance of rain at 0.25%, it seems like there is minimal risk of getting caught in rain. the temperature is quite warm at 31.0°c, which could make outdoor dining pleasant if the breeze is nice and there is some shade. 

however, to make a more comfortable choice, consider a few things:
1. **comfort with humidity:** in higher temperatures, it might feel more humid, which could affect comfort levels outdoors.
2. **backup plan:** if dining outdoors, ensure there is a quick option to move indoors if the weather changes unexpectedly.
3. **preference for ambiance:** if the person prefers a vibrant outdoor atmosphere or enjoys being outside, it could be a good experience. otherwise, a cozy indoor setting might be more comfortable, especially if air conditioning is appealing. 

overall, unless the person has a strong preference either way, both options should be fine, with outdoor dining being a slight favorite due to the low chance of rain. dining experience
